### Apps

| Platform | How to get it |
|----------|--------------|
| **Web** | Self-host with Docker (see below) |
| **Android** | APK from [GitHub Releases](../../releases) or build from source |
| **Windows** | Sempa-branded `.exe` setup (NSIS) or `.msi` from [GitHub Releases](../../releases) (x64 + ARM64) |
| **PWA** | Install from your browser when visiting your Sempa instance |

All apps connect to your self-hosted server — your data stays on your machine.

---

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose (v2).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moorew/sempa.git
cd sempa
bash install.sh
```

The installer asks a few questions (URL, auth method, and optional extras like Tailscale or email-to-task), writes your config, builds the image, and starts the container. The whole process takes about 2 minutes. Everything else — email, calendar, and Jira accounts — is connected later inside the app under **Settings**.

Open the URL it prints and follow the in-app setup wizard to connect your email and calendar.

---

## Self-hosting with Tailscale (recommended)

Tailscale is the easiest way to access Sempa securely from all your devices without exposing it to the public internet.

### Why Tailscale?

- **No port forwarding** — access your server from anywhere on your tailnet
- **Automatic HTTPS** — Tailscale provides TLS certificates via MagicDNS
- **Zero-trust networking** — only your devices can reach the server
- **Works on all platforms** — desktop, mobile, and headless servers

### Setup

1. **Install Tailscale** on your server and all devices you want to access Sempa from: [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)

2. **Run the installer:**
   ```bash
   bash install.sh
   ```
   When asked for the URL, use your Tailscale machine name:
   ```
   https://your-machine.tail1234.ts.net
   ```

3. **Generate a Tailscale auth key** at [Tailscale Admin → Keys](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) and paste it when the installer asks for `TS_AUTHKEY`. This lets the Docker sidecar join your tailnet automatically.

4. **Enable HTTPS** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   tailscale cert your-machine.tail1234.ts.net
   ```
   The bundled `ts-sempa` Docker container handles this automatically.

5. **Connect your phone/desktop app**: Open the app, enter your Tailscale URL (e.g. `https://sempa.tail1234.ts.net`) in the server field, and sign in.

### Alternative: any reverse proxy

Sempa works behind any reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, Traefik). Set `APP_URL` to your public URL and configure the proxy to forward to port 9001. If you go this route, **make sure you have authentication enabled** (Google OAuth or username/password).

---

## Manual setup

If you prefer to configure things by hand:

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moorew/sempa.git
cd sempa
```

**2. Create `.env`** (Docker Compose variable substitution)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set APP_URL to wherever Sempa will live
```

**3. Create `.env.local`** (secrets — never committed)

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Fill in your credentials (see Configuration below)
```

**4. Build and start**

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

**5. Open the app**

Navigate to `APP_URL` in your browser. The first-run wizard will guide you through connecting integrations.

---

## Configuration

All configuration is in two files that you create locally:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.env` | Infrastructure (URL, port) — Docker Compose reads this for variable substitution |
| `.env.local` | Secrets (API keys, credentials) — loaded into the container |

### `.env`

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `APP_URL` | `http://localhost:9001` | The URL where Sempa is accessible (no trailing slash) |
| `HOST_PORT` | `9001` | The port to expose on the host |

### `.env.local`

#### Authentication

Sempa supports two auth methods. You can enable one or both.

**Google Sign-In (recommended)**

Uses OAuth — you sign in with your Google account, no password to manage.

```dotenv
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
# Comma-separated list of allowed Google emails.
# Leave unset to allow any Google account.
SEMPA_ALLOWED_EMAILS=you@gmail.com
```

Setup steps:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application)
3. Add an Authorised redirect URI: `{APP_URL}/api/v1/auth/google/callback`
4. Copy the Client ID and Secret into `.env.local`

> The same credentials are used for Gmail integration — you only need one OAuth client for everything.

**Username & password**

```dotenv
SEMPA_USERNAME=admin
SEMPA_PASSWORD=your-strong-password
```

If `SEMPA_PASSWORD` is not set, auth is disabled entirely (fine for local-only installs on a trusted network like Tailscale).

#### Tailscale (optional)

If you use the bundled Tailscale sidecar (`ts-sempa` service in `docker-compose.yml`), add your auth key:

```dotenv
TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-...
```

Generate one at [Tailscale Admin → Keys](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys). The key is read by the `ts-sempa` container to join your tailnet.

#### Optional

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TS_AUTHKEY` | Auth key for the Tailscale sidecar container |
| `EMAIL_FORWARD_TOKEN` | Secret token for the Cloudflare email-to-task webhook |
| `SMTP_ALLOWED_SENDERS` | Restrict email-to-task senders (comma-separated emails or `@domain`; empty = accept all) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Port for the built-in inbound SMTP server (default: `2525`) |
| `VAPID_SUBJECT` | Web Push contact address (e.g. `mailto:you@example.com`); the VAPID key pair auto-generates |
| `FCM_KEY_PATH` | Path to a Firebase service-account JSON key for native Android push |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Ollama endpoint for AI task-title cleanup (default: the bundled `ollama` service). These set the defaults; the feature can also be toggled and the model chosen in **Settings → Integrations**. |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | Local model for AI task-title cleanup (default: `qwen2.5:1.5b`, bundled — no API key) |
| `INBOX_POLL_INTERVAL` | How often to poll the email inbox (default: `1m`) |
| `CALENDAR_POLL_INTERVAL` | How often to refresh ICS subscriptions + the Fastmail calendar (default: `15m`; empty disables) |

---

## Integrations

All integrations are optional and configured through the Settings UI after first login.

| Integration | What it does |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Gmail** | Imports starred emails as tasks. Uses the same OAuth app as sign-in. |
| **Google Calendar** | Shows today's events in the Schedule panel. Enabled via the Gmail settings page. |
| **Fastmail** | Imports starred emails as tasks via IMAP. App password required. |
| **Fastmail Calendar** | Syncs JMAP calendar events into the Schedule panel. |
| **Jira** | Imports assigned issues as tasks. Marking a Jira-sourced task done closes the ticket. |
| **Calendar feeds (ICS)** | Subscribe to any `.ics` / webcal URL for read-only events. |
| **Email inbox** | Forward any email to a Fastmail address to auto-create a task. |
| **AI task-title cleanup** | A local language model (Ollama, bundled) tidies imported email subjects into concise task titles. Runs entirely on your server — no data leaves it. Toggle, choose the model, and test connectivity in Settings → Integrations. |

> **Note on the model-server URL (AI task-title cleanup).** The Ollama endpoint
> is configurable in Settings → Integrations and may point at an internal /
> loopback address — that's by design, because the model server is self-hosted
> (e.g. `http://ollama:11434`). Static analysis (CodeQL `go/request-forgery`)
> flags this as a possible SSRF because a configured URL drives a server-side
> request. It's a **deliberate, accepted trade-off**: the URL is settable only
> by the authenticated instance owner (who already controls the server), is
> validated to be a well-formed `http(s)` URL, and restricting it to public
> hosts would defeat the feature. See `SECURITY.md`.

## Connecting mobile & desktop apps

The Android app and Windows desktop app connect to your self-hosted server:

1. **Install the app** from [GitHub Releases](../../releases)
2. **Open the app** — you'll see a "Server URL" field
3. **Enter your server address** (e.g. `https://sempa.tail1234.ts.net`)
4. **Sign in** with your Google account or username/password

Both your phone and server must be on the same Tailscale network (or the server must be reachable from your phone's network).

> **Tip:** Install Tailscale on your phone to access your server from anywhere, even on mobile data.

## User Guide

Everything below is how to *use* Sempa day to day. Features work the same on web, the Windows desktop app, and Android, except where noted.

### First run

After signing in, a short setup wizard helps you connect email and calendar (all optional — you can skip and add them later in **Settings**). You land on **Today**.

### Getting around

- **Desktop / web:** a left sidebar with Today, Search, This Week, Plan Day, Email, Backlog, Shutdown, Journal, and Jira. A compact **icon rail** at the bottom holds Settings, the light/dark toggle, the desktop Widget, and your account (avatar → email + sign out). The day view's right panel is a tabbed dock — **Schedule · Inbox · Jira · Goals** — under a mini-calendar.
- **Mobile:** a bottom tab bar — **Today**, **Week**, **Journal**, and **More**. The **More** sheet is grouped: a quick row (Settings, light/dark, Widget), a **Plan** group (Plan Day, Schedule, Backlog, Search), an **Inbox** group (Email, Reminders, Jira, Shutdown), and your account row. A **+** button creates a task on list screens.

### Tasks

The core unit. Open any task to edit it in a panel (desktop) or bottom sheet (mobile).

- **Create:** the **+** button, the “Add task” box, or press `n` on a day view.
- **Title & notes:** notes support pasted URLs, which render as tidy **link preview chips** (title, site, thumbnail) instead of raw links.
- **Status:** `backlog → planned → in progress → done` (plus `cancelled`). On the week board you change status by dragging between columns; in a task you toggle it done with the checkbox.
- **Due date & time estimate:** pick a due date with the styled date picker and an estimate (15 min – 8 h) used for planning.
- **Tags:** type to add colour-coded tags; they show as coloured dots on compact cards.
- **Sub-tasks:** break a task into a checklist of smaller items.
- **Time-blocking:** give a task a scheduled start/end so it appears as a block on the Schedule panel next to your calendar events.
- **“Roughly at”:** a soft time hint (e.g. “around 2pm”) that orders a task in the day without committing to a hard block.
- **Reminders:** set **Remind me** (date + time) for a hard alert — see [Reminders & notifications](#reminders-notifications--routines).
- **Attachments:** attach files to a task (or objective); stored on your server.

Press `e` to edit the hovered task on a day view.

### Plan your day

**Plan Day** (`/plan`) is a guided morning ritual: write your **intention** for the day, see what carried over **from yesterday**, and pull tasks from your backlog into today. Your previous day’s note is shown for continuity.

### Week view

The **Week** board is a Kanban across the seven days. Drag tasks between days and statuses, set **Weekly Objectives** (the handful of outcomes that matter this week), and link tasks to an objective so progress is visible.

### Weekly planning & review

- **Plan the week:** review your backlog and schedule the week ahead. This is also surfaced automatically as a gentle in-app prompt (see Routines).
- **Weekly review:** capture **Wins**, **Challenges**, and your **Next focus**. Reviews are saved per week and searchable.

### Daily shutdown

**Shutdown** (`/shutdown`) is an end-of-day ritual: tick off what’s done, **reschedule** anything unfinished, record a **win** and an optional reflection, and close the day cleanly. Like weekly planning, it can prompt you automatically at a time you choose.

### Backlog

A single list of everything not yet scheduled. Use it as your inbox of ideas and pull items into days as you plan.

### Journal

The **Journal** collects your daily **intentions** and **reflections** and your weekly **wins / challenges / next focus** in one timeline. You can have intentions and reflections also appear inline on the day and week screens (toggle in **Settings → Appearance**, “contextual reflections”).

### Focus & Pomodoro

Open a task in **Focus** mode to work distraction-free with a built-in **Pomodoro** timer. Completed sessions are logged per task, so you can see time actually spent vs. your estimate.

### Search & tag filters

**Search** looks across tasks, objectives, and journal entries. On list views you can switch into **tag filter mode** to show only tasks with a given tag.

### Recurring tasks

Create **daily, weekly, or monthly** templates (managed in **Settings → Recurring Tasks**). Instances are generated automatically; editing one instance customises just that occurrence while the series rolls forward.

### Calendars & schedule

See calendar events beside your tasks in the **Schedule** tab of the day view's right-hand dock (alongside Inbox, Jira, and Goals):

- **Google Calendar** and **Fastmail Calendar** — connect in **Settings → Integrations / Accounts**.
- **CalDAV** — connect a CalDAV server and optionally push your time-blocks back to it.
- **ICS / webcal feeds** — subscribe to any read-only calendar URL.

In **Settings → Calendars** you can show/hide each calendar and cycle its colour through the brand palette.

### Email → tasks

Turn email into tasks several ways:

- **Gmail / Fastmail:** star an email and it imports as a task (same OAuth app as sign-in for Gmail; an app password for Fastmail).
- **Task inbox:** forward (or auto-forward) mail to a dedicated address to create tasks; allow-list senders in settings.
- **AI title cleanup:** imported subjects are tidied into clean task titles by the bundled local model (the `ollama` service) — no API key needed.

The **Email** screen lets you triage incoming mail and convert messages to tasks, with the original linked.

### Jira

Connect Jira to import your assigned issues as tasks. Marking a Jira-sourced task **done** transitions/closes the linked ticket. You can also view issue details and available transitions from the task.

### Reminders, notifications & routines

Configured in **Settings → Notifications**.

**Per-task reminders.** Set **Remind me** (date + time) on any task for a hard alert. It fires with two quick actions — **Mark done** and **Snooze 1h** — and tapping the notification opens the app on that task. Reminders are deduplicated, so re-arming or snoozing won’t double-fire.

**Delivery channels** (toggle each independently):

- **Web Push** — native OS notifications on Windows/Android browsers and installed PWAs. Click **Enable** to grant permission; it subscribes this device.
- **Native Android** — push to the installed Android app.
- **Custom webhook** — POST notifications to a self-hosted service such as **ntfy** or **Gotify**. Enter the endpoint URL, optional topic, HTTP method, and an auth header/token, then use **Send test notification** to verify the handshake.

**Alert sound.** Turn the custom sound on and pick from **10 calm tones** (Carbon Piano, Handpan, Kalimba, Waterside, and more) — each row has a **▶ preview**. The choice applies to in-app alerts, Android notification channels, and the desktop reminder.

**In-app routines.** Set the day/time for the **Weekly planning** prompt and the time + workdays for the **Daily shutdown** prompt. These appear as calm in-app banners (not OS alarms) that guide you into the matching workflow.

**Will reminders fire if I’m offline?** Yes, within reason:

| Situation | What happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| Server briefly down | The reminder fires when the server returns (late, not lost) |
| Android device fully offline / app closed | An **on-device OS alarm** still fires (scheduled locally from your tasks) |
| Settings changed offline | Saved locally and synced to the server on reconnect |
| Windows desktop, app running | Fires in-app with your chosen sound |
| Windows desktop, app closed | Reminders need the app running (no background push in the desktop shell) |

> Custom notification *sounds* play for the in-app/desktop reminder, the settings preview, and Android channels. A **background** web-push notification on a plain browser uses the OS default sound — a browser platform limit.

### Backup & restore

In **Settings → Backup & Restore**:

- **Automatic daily backups** at an hour you choose, with a retention count.
- **Encryption** — optionally protect backups with a passphrase.
- **Destinations** — keep backups locally or push to **S3**, **WebDAV**, or **Google Drive**. Use **Test** to verify a destination.
- **Run now** for an on-demand backup, **Download** the latest archive, or **Restore** from a file.

Database migrations run automatically on startup, and your data lives in the `sempa_data` Docker volume.

### Today board

The **Today** view is a rolling board of day columns with today anchored at the left edge. Scroll left into the past and right into the future **continuously** — there are no week boundaries to page through. The ‹ › header buttons and the `j`/`k` keys jump a week at a time; **Today** re-anchors on the current day.

### Desktop widget

The Windows desktop app includes a floating **Widget** — a compact, always-on-top panel showing what's up next with quick checkboxes and a quick-add box. Open it from the sidebar icon rail (or a single click on the system-tray icon); the tray's double-click opens the main window.

### Offline & sync

The desktop and Android apps are **local-first**: they keep a local copy of your data, so the app stays fully usable with no connection. Changes queue and **sync automatically** when the server is reachable again. A sync indicator shows status. Plain web (in a browser, not installed) talks directly to the server.

### Themes & appearance

In **Settings → Appearance** you pick from **six full-interface themes** — **Terracotta** (default), **Forest**, **Plum**, **Slate**, **OLED Black**, and **Ocean** — each with a live preview. Every theme has a light and a dark mode, except **OLED Black**, which is dark-only (the mode toggle hides for it). The same page has a **text-size** slider and the **contextual reflections** toggle. Your choice is remembered per device and applied before first paint (no flash on load).

### Settings overview

| Section | What you configure |
|---------|--------------------|
| **Account** | Sign-in, profile |
| **Integrations** | Gmail, Fastmail, Jira, CalDAV, task inbox |
| **Calendars** | Connected calendars, ICS/webcal feeds, show/hide, colours |
| **Tags** | Create/rename/recolour tags |
| **Recurring Tasks** | Daily/weekly/monthly templates |
| **Notifications** | Reminders, delivery channels, sounds, routines |
| **Backup & Restore** | Schedule, encryption, destinations |
| **Appearance** | Theme (six options), light/dark mode, text size, contextual reflections |

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | New task (day view) |
| `e` | Edit the hovered task (day view) |
| `t` | Go to today |
| `j` | Previous week |
| `k` | Next week |
| `?` | Show shortcuts help |
| `Esc` | Close the open dialog |

## Upgrading

```bash
git pull
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Database migrations run automatically on startup. Your data is in a Docker volume (`sempa_data`) and is preserved across rebuilds.

---

## Development

**Requirements:** Go 1.25+, Node.js 20+

```bash
# Backend (runs on :9001)
cd backend
go run ./cmd/server/

# Frontend (runs on :5173, proxies API to :9001)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server sets `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9001` automatically via `.env.development`. You can set `SEMPA_PASSWORD=dev` in your shell to enable auth locally.

### Building native apps

```bash
# Android (requires Android SDK)
cd frontend
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android   # opens in Android Studio

# Windows (requires Rust toolchain)
cd frontend
npm run tauri build
```

### Project structure

```

## Philosophy

- **Single-user per instance.** Each person runs their own copy — like Gitea or Vaultwarden. Your data stays on your server.
- **No cloud dependency.** Runs fully offline once configured. External services (Gmail, Jira) are optional integrations.
- **Small footprint.** ~10 MB Docker image, ~20 MB RAM. SQLite database — no separate database server.
- **API-first.** Everything the frontend does goes through the REST API.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Android app (Capacitor)
- [x] Windows desktop app (Tauri)
- [ ] Slack integration
- [ ] CalDAV write-back (create Sempa tasks as calendar events)
- [ ] Public Docker image on GitHub Container Registry
