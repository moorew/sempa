# Changelog

All notable, user-facing changes to Sempa are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and Sempa follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release is also tagged in git
(`vX.Y.Z`) with auto-generated notes on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/moorew/sempa/releases).

## [1.0.117] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **AI model management.** Settings → Integrations → AI now lists every downloaded
  model with its on-disk **size**, lets you pick the active one, **download a new
  model with a live progress bar**, and **remove** a model (with a confirm that it
  must be re-downloaded). Backed by new server endpoints that proxy Ollama
  pull/delete and report progress.
- **Action feedback in AI settings.** Test/Save and model actions now report clearly
  ("Connected · N models", "AI settings saved", "Nothing to save", "Downloaded X",
  "Removed X") instead of silently doing nothing.

### Changed
- **Sync status is now a floating widget** (bottom-right): a permanent compact cloud
  icon (cloud-off when offline) whose label fades in only on hover, while
  syncing/pending/offline/errored, or briefly after a sync — freeing the left rail.
  The sidebar footer (utility icons + account) is correspondingly shorter.
- **Platform-correct keyboard shortcuts.** The Search hint shows `Ctrl+K` on
  Windows/Linux and `⌘K` on macOS, and the shortcut now actually opens Search.

## [1.0.116] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **More theme-aware highlights.** The right-panel docks weren't fully themed: the
  Inbox/Email tab underline, unread dot and "→ Task" button, the Jira issue keys and
  links, the Jira "Medium" priority marker, and the weekly Goals progress bar/dots used
  fixed blue/yellow/amber that ignored the active theme. They now follow `--sempa-accent`
  (and `--sempa-amber` for the Medium-priority marker), matching the rest of the UI.
- **Local AI connection (deploy).** On the default compose, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` resolved to
  a bridge hostname the host-networked app container couldn't reach. Combined with the
  1.0.115 compose change, the app now talks to Ollama over loopback; existing servers just
  set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

### Changed
- **Email view restyled.** The full Inbox now renders each message as a themed card (like
  the Reminders view) instead of a flat divider list, with inline "→ Task" / "Archive"
  actions — all using the theme tokens.

## [1.0.115] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **In-app updates.** A subtle update indicator in the left rail, a brand-controlled
  "update available" toast (Download · What's new · Later), and **Settings → About**
  showing the current version, update channel (Stable/Beta), automatic-checks toggle,
  last-checked time, and a manual "Check for updates". Works on web and desktop by
  polling GitHub Releases — no signing required. The full silent background
  auto-update path (tauri-plugin-updater) is scaffolded and documented in
  `docs/UPDATER.md`; it activates once an updater signing key is added to CI.
- **Local AI is now opt-in at install.** `install.sh` asks whether you want local
  AI for text processing; if yes it starts Ollama, pulls `qwen2.5:1.5b`, prefills
  the in-app AI fields, and verifies the connection. Otherwise Ollama isn't started.
- **Sectioned navigation rail** with a pinned Search pill and a configurable grouping
  (Settings → Appearance: Spaces / Plan·Focus·Review / Flat, with Labels or Dividers).

### Fixed
- **Local AI connection.** Ollama ran on a bridge network the (host-networked) app
  container couldn't resolve (`http://ollama:11434`), so the AI test returned 404 /
  "not reachable". It now runs on the host namespace bound to loopback and the app
  talks to it over `127.0.0.1` — and only runs when you opt in.
- **Theme-aware highlights.** Orange/amber that ignored the active theme now follows
  it: the Pomodoro timer, overdue/focus task badges, backup warnings, the AI status
  dot, and the Schedule calendar swatches (no longer stuck orange in cool themes).
- **Left rail polish.** Footer icons no longer squash (distorting their highlight),
  the sync status no longer collides with the icons, and the account avatar is now a
  proper chip (avatar + email + Sign out) instead of an orphaned button.

## [1.0.114] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Installer no longer aborts when you enter a custom value.** `install.sh` ran
  under `set -e`, and its `ask_default` helper returned a non-zero status whenever
  you typed anything other than the default (App URL, host port, or username),
  silently exiting the script right after the first prompt. Accepting every
  default happened to work, which hid the bug.
- Made `install.sh` portable to hosts with BusyBox `grep` (e.g. minimal/Alpine
  systems): replaced `grep -oP` for the Docker version and URL port with
  bash-native parsing.
- Hardened the "update existing install" backup step so it can't abort when only
  one of `.env` / `.env.local` is present.

### Changed
- **Clarified Tailscale setup docs.** The README and installer now explain that
  the bundled `ts-sempa` sidecar joins the tailnet as its own dedicated node
  (`sempa.<your-tailnet>.ts.net`) rather than reusing the host machine's name,
  and document the MagicDNS/HTTPS and `tag:container` prerequisites. Removed the
  incorrect manual `tailscale cert` step (Serve provisions the cert automatically).
- Relicensed under AGPL-3.0; added CONTRIBUTING and this changelog.
- Routine dependency updates.

### Added
- Auto-tagging workflow: bumping the version in `frontend/package.json` on `main`
  now cuts the matching `vX.Y.Z` tag and kicks off the release builds.

## [1.0.113] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- **Recurring tasks now appear on future days across all platforms.** Recurring
  instances were generated lazily server-side only when a web client requested a
  given week, so offline-first desktop/Android clients (which read the local DB)
  saw a daily task "end" after the current week. A background poller now
  proactively materialises the current week plus the next two weeks.

### Security
- Updated Go toolchain to 1.25.11, fixing reachable standard-library
  vulnerabilities (GO-2026-5037/5038/5039, GO-2026-4986, GO-2026-4971).
- Updated `go-chi/chi` to v5.2.2, fixing GO-2025-3770 (open redirect).
- Added continuous security scanning (CodeQL, govulncheck, Trivy, gitleaks,
  zizmor, OpenSSF Scorecard) and Dependabot; pinned all GitHub Actions to commit
  SHAs.
